  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - CHANGED: Disable firmware check by default since this project
             does not update frequently. You still can enable
             the firmware periodic check manually after the factory
             default reset.

  - FIXED: Cannot set traffic history save frequency to every 1 week
           from webui.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: First time you boot into this version, you need to
          either shift-reload the main index page, or clear
          your browser cache.

  - NEW: Introducing VPN Director, which replaces the original
         policy routing management interface for OpenVPN clients.
         A bit similar to Asus's own VPN Fusion, OpenVPN routing
         rules are now managed through a central web interface,
         and they are stored in JFFS instead of nvram, to allow
         creating more rules, and free up some nvram for
         nvram-limited devices such as the RT-AC68U.
         See the Wiki for more information.

  - NEW: Added QR codes to the networkmap as well as the Guest
         Network page, to allow easily connecting a mobile
         device just by scanning the QR code.
         The generated QR code can also be saved as a file
         if you'd like to print it.

  - CHANGED: Rewrote OpenVPN routing handling.  The firmware will
             now handle route creation itself rather than letting
             the openvpn client create/remove routes.
             The new implementation brings a few changes:

             - "Force Internet traffic through tunnel" can now
               be set to "No", "Yes (All)" or "VPN Director".
             - This setting will now override whatever setting
               pushed by the server regarding gateway redirection.
             - The kill switch can now be used in both "Yes" and
               "VPN Director" routing modes
             - Manually stopping a client will remove the kill
               switch.  It will now only be applied at boot time
               (if client was set to start at boot), or if the
               tunnel is disconnected through a non-user event

  - CHANGED: Reworked OpenVPN's DNS Exclusive mode implementation
             and interaction with dnsmasq.
  - CHANGED: Moved OpenVPN Custom settings content to JFFS, and
             increased max storage length from around 350 chars
             to 4095 chars.
  - CHANGED: Moved the "Redirect Internet traffic" setting on
             the OpenVPN Client page to the Network Settings
             section to increase its visibility, as too many
             users are forgetting to configure it.
  - CHANGED: Display "Internet traffic not redirected" instead
             of "Public IP Unknown" on the OpenVPN Client
             status display when Redirect Internet traffic
             is set to "No".
  - UPDATED: chart.js to 2.9.4.
  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.5.8.
  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to June 5th 2021.
  - UPDATED: nano to 5.7.
  - UPDATED: curl to 7.76.1.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.85-openssl.
  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.3.
  - UPDATED: getdns to 1.7.0.
  - UPDATED: stubby to 0.4.0.
  - FIXED: Setting an OpenVPN client's DNS mode to Exclusive
           could fail to work for certain configurations
  - FIXED: DNS Exclusive redirections applied in Policy mode
           could be executed in the wrong order if you had
           overlapping policy rules in two separate clients.
  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 couldn't be
           routed through an OpenVPN tunnel.
  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 would bypass
           DNSFilter rules.
  - FIXED: Missing error report on OpenVPN client connection
           failure
  - FIXED: profile.add getting used even if JFFS scripting
           was disabled (dave14305)
  - FIXED: Freedns authentication errors would not
           properly be reported as errors.
  - FIXED: Only the first OpenVPN client would be used if
           you had multiple clients connected and the first
           one had a Redirect Internet set to "No".  Now,
           setting this to "No" means that client's routing
           table will no longer get a default gateway
           configured, allowing traffic to be processed
           by other RPDB tables if there wasn't a matching
           route within that client's table.
  - FIXED: IPV6-compatible DNSFilter servers weren't
           properly configured in dnsmasq.
  - FIXED: DNSFilter client rules may get corrupted after a
           reboot.
