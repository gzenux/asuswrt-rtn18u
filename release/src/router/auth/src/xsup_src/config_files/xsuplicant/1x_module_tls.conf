# This is an example configuration file for xsupplicant versions after 0.8b.

### GLOBAL SECTION

# network_list: defines all of the networks in this file which 
#      should be kept in memory and used.Comma delimited list or "all"
#      for keeping all defined configurations in memory. For efficiency,
#      keep only the networks you might roam to in memory.
#      To avoid errors, make sure your default network is always
#      in the network_list.  In general, you will want to leave this set to 
#      "all".

#network_list = default, test1, test2
network_list = all

# default_netname: some users may actually have a network named "default".
#      since "default" is a keyword in the network section below, you can
#      change which is to be used as the replacement for this keyword

#default_netname = my_defaults
default_netname = default

# In the startup_command, first_auth_command, and reauth_command you can
# use "%i" to have xsupplicant fill in the interface that is being used. 
# This allows a single network profile to work across different wireless
# cards.

# startup_command: the command to run when xsupplicant is first started.
#   this command can do things such as configure the card to associate with
#   the network properly.
#startup_command = <BEGIN_COMMAND>echo "some command"<END_COMMAND>

# first_auth_command: the command to run when xsupplicant authenticates to
#   a wireless network for the first time.  This will usually be used to
#   start a DHCP client process.
#first_auth_command = <BEGIN_COMMAND>dhclient %i<END_COMMAND>

# reauth_command: the command to run when xsupplicant reauthenticates to a
#   wireless network.  This may be used to have the dhcp client rerequest
#   it's IP address.
#reauth_command = <BEGIN_COMMAND>echo "authenticated user %i"<END_COMMAND>

# When running in daemon, or non-foreground mode, you may want to have the
# output of the program.  So, define a log file here.  Each time XSupplicant
# is started, this file will be replaced.  So, there is no need to roll the
# log file.
# logfile = /var/log/xsupplicant.log

# The auth_period, held_period, and max_starts modify the timers in the state
# machine.  (Please reference the 802.1x spec for info on how they are used.)
# For most people, there is no reason to define these values, as the defaults
# should work.

#auth_period = 30

#held_period = 30

#max_starts = 3

# Defining an interface in "allow_interfaces" will bypass the rules that
# xsupplicant uses to determine if an interface is valid.  For most people
# this setting shouldn't be needed.  It is useful for having xsupplicant
# attempt to authenticate on interfaces that don't appear to be true
# physical interfaces.  (i.e. Virtual interfaces such as eth0:1)

#allow_interfaces = eth0, wlan0

# Defining an interface in "deny_interfaces" will prevent xsupplicant from
# attempting to authenticate on a given interface.  This is useful if you
# know that you will never do 802.1x on a specific interface.  However,
# allows will take priority over denies, so defining the same interface in
# the allow_interfaces, and deny_interfaces will result in the interface
# being used.

#deny_interfaces = eth1

###  NETWORK SECTION



# The general format of the network section is a network name followed
# by a group of variables.

# Network names may contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', 
# '_', '\', '/'
# Those interested in having an SSID with ANY character in it can use
# the ssid tag within the network clause. Otherwise, your ssid will
# be the name of the network.

## The default network is not a network itself. These values are 
## the default used for any network parameters not overridden 
## in another section. If it's not in your network configuration
## and not in your default, it won't work!!

default  
{ 
  # type: the type of this network. wired or wireless, if this value is not
  # set, xsupplicant will attempt to determine if the interface is wired or
  # wireless.  In general, you should only need to define this when
  # xsupplicant incorrectly identifies your network interface.
  type = wireless

  # wireless_control: If this profile is forced to wired, this will not do
  # anything.  However, if the interface is forced, or detected to be wireless
  # XSupplicant will take control of re/setting WEP keys when the machine 
  # first starts, and when it jumps to a different AP.  In general, you won't
  # need to define, or set this value.
  # wireless_control = yes

  # allow_types:  describes which EAP types this network will allow.  The
  # first type listed will be requested if the server tries to use something
  # not in this list.
  # allow_types = eap_tls, eap_md5, eap_gtc, eap-otp
  allow_types = eap_tls
  # allow_types = eap_md5

  # identity:  what to respond with when presented with an EAP Id Request
  #   Typically, this is the username for this network. Since this can
  #   be an arbitrary string, enclose within <BEGIN_ID> and <END_ID>

  # Force xsupplicant to send it's packets to this destination MAC address.
  # In most cases, this isn't needed, and shouldn't be defined.
